          <p class = "bigscreen">Hi there,</p>
          <p>Hi there,</p>

          I'm Nico.
          I come alive at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and product design. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at <a href = "https://educai.io" title = "" target="_blank">Educai</a>, a London-based EdTech startup backed by <a href = "https://foundersfactory.com/" title = "" target="_blank">Founders Factory</a>. We're working towards building the future of personalised learning through a behavioural matching engine, which I'm responsible for. I joined Educai a year ago as their first data science hire.
          
          </br>
          
          Previously, I was part of the product team @ <a href = "https://decoded.com" title = "" target="_blank">Decoded</a>, where we designed cutting-edge data science and machine learning workshops and delivered them to some of the most innovative companies in the world including UBS, Nike, and Vodafone.

        </br>

        I have a background in Maths, and hold a MSc in Machine Learning from <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London" title = "University College London" target="_blank">UCL</a>. My dissertation investigated algorithmic designs to mitigate polarisation in online recommender systems (a joint project between <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/about" title="UCL Computer Science" target="_blank">UCL CS</a> and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/public-policy/" title="" target="_blank">UCL Public Policy</a>).

        </br>

        I'm always happy to discuss all things startups, ML, and Web3; feel free to <a href = "mailto:nico.ward@hey.com" title = 'nico.ward@hey.com'>reach out</a> for a chat.
