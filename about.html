          <p class = "bigscreen">Hey there,</p>
          <p>Hey there,</p>

          I'm Nico Ward.

          I come alive at the intersection of education, product design and machine learning. Currently, I'm part of the product team @ <a href = "https://decoded.com" title = "" target="_blank">Decoded</a> &mdash; a London-based EdTech company. We build fun, educational products that demystify data, from ML and AI to data visualisation, data-driven business strategy and data ethics.

        </br>

        I recently graduated from <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London" title = "University College London" target="_blank">UCL</a> with a MSc in Machine Learning. My dissertation investigated algorithmic designs to mitigate polarisation in online recommender systems (a joint project between <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/about" title="" target="_blank">UCL CS</a> and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/public-policy/" title="" target="_blank">UCL Public Policy</a>).
        Previously, I was @ <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nice_Sophia_Antipolis" target="_blank">University of Nice</a> studying applied maths (with a focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory" title="" target="_blank">Game Theory</a>).
        </br>

        <p>(AI + Design)</p>

        My research interests are three-fold:
        within AI, I'm primarily interested in natural language and its applications;
        within design, I'm interested in building learner-friendly AI systems;
        within tech policy, I'm interested in issues of AI ethics in the nearterm, particularly concerning fairness,
        misinformation, and the ethical use of AI algorithms.

        </br>

        <p>Let's chat.</p>

        I'm always happy to exchange about all things AI, EdTech and ethics. If you'd like to chat, feel free to <a href = "mailto:nico.ward@hey.com" title = 'nico.ward@hey.com'>email</a> me. Sometimes I also share memes on <a href = "http://www.twitter.com/@neuralnico" title = '@neuralnico' target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
