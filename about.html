          I'm Nico Ward.

          I come alive at the intersection of education, product design and machine learning. Currently, I'm pursuing a MSc in Machine Learning @ <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London" title = "University College London" target="_blank">UCL</a>.

        </br>

        Previously, I was over @ <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nice_Sophia_Antipolis" target="_blank">University of Nice</a> studying applied maths.
        During my time there, I got the opportunity to intern in Data Science @ <a href = "http://www.amadeus.com" target="_blank">Amadeus</a> and in Machine Learning @ <a href = "http://www.knap.fr" target="_blank">Knap</a>. I also led a team of six in designing an adaptive learning interface for museums, which was rewarded @ <a href = "http://www.demola.net" target="_blank">Demola</a>. For more info, here's my <a href = "nw - cv.pdf" target = '_blank'>CV</a>.
        </br>

        <p>(AI + Design)</p>

        My research interests are three-fold:
        within AI, I'm primarily interested in natural language and computer vision;
        within design, I'm interested in building AI systems able to understand and respond to human emotion;
        within technology policy, I'm interested in issues of AI ethics in the nearterm, particularly concerning fairness,
        misinformation, and the ethical use of AI algorithms.

        </br>

        <p>Let's chat.</p>

        I'm always happy to exchange about all things AI, edTech and ethics. If you'd like to chat, feel free to <a href = "mailto:nico.ward@hey.com" title = 'nico.ward@hey.com'>email</a> me. Sometimes I also share memes on <a href = "http://www.twitter.com/@neuralnico" title = '@neuralnico' target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
