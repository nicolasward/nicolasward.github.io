          I'm Nicolas Ward.

          I come alive at the intersection of machine learning and design.

        </br>

          I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Machine Learning @ <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London" target="_blank">University College London</a>.

        Previously, I was over at the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nice_Sophia_Antipolis" target="_blank">University of Nice</a> studying mathematics and economics.

        </br>

        During my time there, I got the opportunity to intern in Data Science @ <a href = "http://www.amadeus.com" target="_blank">Amadeus</a> and in Machine Learning @ <a href = "http://www.knap.fr" target="_blank">Knap</a>. I also led an awesome team in building
        an interactive learning experience for children in museums, which was rewarded @ <a href = "http://www.demola.net" target="_blank">Demola</a>.

        </br>

        <p>(AI + Design)</p>

        My research interests are three-fold:
        within AI, I'm primarily interested in computer vision and its links to augmented reality;
        within design, I'm interested in building AI systems able to understand and respond to human emotion;
        within technology policy, I'm interested in issues of AI ethics in the nearterm, particularly concerning human-machine collaboration,
        misinformation, and the ethical use of AI algorithms.

        </br>

        <p>Let's chat.</p>

        I enjoy exchanging with companies and designers about all things AI, design and ethics. If you'd like to chat, feel free to shoot me an <a href = "mailto:ward.nicolas@outlook.com">email</a>.
